# modules-app

This is an iOS mock-app showing information about some Eurorack modules.

The API is a simple GET-only FastAPI stored on my local NAS with dynamic DNS. Hopefully, it will be reachable when you try the app. ðŸ˜¬
The JSON-data only contains about 40 of the most popular modules, according to ModularGrid.
